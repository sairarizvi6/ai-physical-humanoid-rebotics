# Introduction to Physical AI

Welcome to the Physical AI chapter!  

Physical AI focuses on designing and building intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world. This includes robots, sensors, actuators, and algorithms that allow machines to perceive, reason, and act in real-world environments.

In this chapter, you will learn about:

- The fundamentals of physical AI systems
- How sensors and actuators work
- Basic robotics concepts
- Integrating AI algorithms with physical devices
- Applications in autonomous robots, smart devices, and simulation

This is the starting point for your journey into the world of Physical AI. Each section will guide you step by step to understand and build intelligent systems that can sense, think, and act.
