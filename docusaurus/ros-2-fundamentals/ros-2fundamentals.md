ROS 2 Documentation
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications. From drivers and state-of-the-art algorithms to powerful developer tools, ROS has the open source tools you need for your next robotics project.

Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isn’t.

Are you looking for documentation for a particular ROS package like MoveIt, image_proc, or octomap? Please see ROS Index or check out this index of per-package documentation.

This site contains the documentation for ROS 2. If you are looking for ROS 1 documentation, check out the ROS wiki.

If you use ROS 2 in your work, please see Citations to cite ROS 2.
