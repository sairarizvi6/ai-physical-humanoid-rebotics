# Chapter 6: Capstone - Simple AI-Robot Pipeline

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned in previous chapters to build a complete AI-robot pipeline that demonstrates the principles of Physical AI in action.

## Project Overview

The capstone project combines:

- Physical AI principles
- Humanoid robotics concepts
- ROS 2 framework
- Digital twin simulation
- Vision-language-action systems

## Implementation Steps

1. Design the robot architecture
2. Implement perception systems
3. Create decision-making algorithms
4. Integrate action systems
5. Test in simulation
6. Deploy to physical robot

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this capstone, you will have:

- Integrated multiple AI and robotics technologies
- Built a complete AI-robot pipeline
- Applied Physical AI principles in practice
- Developed a working prototype
