# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI is an interdisciplinary field that combines robotics, machine learning, and physics to create intelligent systems that can interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI focuses on embodied intelligence that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments.

## Key Concepts

- **Embodied Intelligence**: Intelligence that emerges from the interaction between an agent and its physical environment
- **Sensorimotor Learning**: Learning through sensing and acting in the physical world
- **Physics-Informed AI**: AI systems that incorporate physical laws and constraints

## Applications

Physical AI has applications in various domains:

- Robotics and automation
- Healthcare and assistive technologies
- Manufacturing and logistics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Human-robot interaction

## Challenges

Creating effective Physical AI systems presents unique challenges:

- Real-time perception and decision making
- Uncertainty in physical environments
- Safety and reliability requirements
- Integration of multiple sensory modalities
