# Chapter 3: ROS 2 Fundamentals

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior.

## Core Concepts

- **Nodes**: Processes that perform computation
- **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication
- **Actions**: Asynchronous goal-oriented communication

## Architecture

ROS 2 uses a DDS (Data Distribution Service) implementation for communication between nodes, providing:

- Real-time performance
- Distributed systems support
- Language independence
- Platform independence

## Key Features

- Improved security
- Better real-time support
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Deterministic behavior
